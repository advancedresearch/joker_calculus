### Introduction

Joker Calculus is used to describe language bias in philosophical positions.

You can think of Joker Calculus as extending bits with two modes of evaluation (Open and Closed):

```text
0 = Platonism
1 = Seshatism

!0 = 1 (in both Open and Closed variant)
!1 = 0 (in both Open and Closed variant)
```

There is a "Joker" operator `?`:

```text
?0 = (0, 1) = Something that appears to be 1 but actually is 0
?1 = (1, 0) = Something that appears to be 0 but actually is 1

(0, 0) = 0
(1, 1) = 1
```

There is also a perspective operator:

```text
0 1 = Something that is like 1 but seen from the perspective of 0
1 0 = Something that is like 0 but seen from the perspective of 1
```

These operators are used to build more complex expressions, such as:

```
0 ?1 = 0 (in Closed Variant) = Something who stands for 1 but "embraces" 0
1 ?0 = 1 (in Closed variant) = Something who stands for 0 but "embraces" 1
```

This also allows expressing positions that are co-dependingly "stuck in inauthenticity":

```text
!(1 0) = 0 ?0 = Something who stands for 0 but "can not perceive itself from" 1
!(0 1) = 1 ?1 = Something who stands for 1 but "can not perceive itself from" 0
```

### Authenticity and inauthenticity in sense of Heidegger

[Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger) thought a lot about "authenticity and "inauthenticity" in Being.
This idea has been used in Joker Calculus from a Wittgensteinean perspective of the relationship between language and logic.

In Joker Calculus, one says a language bias is "inauthentic" if it contains a Joker after being evaluated in the Closed Variant.
This means, the language can not get rid of some internal boundary between two languages of different biases.

For example, when I see your position `0` from my position `1`, I can express this as `1 0`.
This is considered an authentic position, even though I am biased.

However, when I pretend to have some position `0` while actually having a position `1`,
this is considered an inauthentic position, since it can be expressed as `(1, 0) = ?1`.
This language bias is inauthentic because it contains a Joker.

A third example is when I "embrace" a position `0` while holding a position `1`, which is expressed as `0 ?1 = 0` in the Closed Variant.

- I hold the position `1`
- I appear to hold the position `0`, hence `(1, 0) = ?1`
- My position is seen from the position `0` as embracing `0`, hence `0 ?1 = 0` in the Closed Variant

Joker Calculus can sometimes get rid of Jokers when evaluating in the Closed Variant.
These positions are considered authentic.

### Example: Hello Joker

```rust
use joker_calculus::*;

fn main() {
    let a = platonism();
    let b = not(a.clone());
    assert_eq!(b.eval_closed(), seshatism());
}
```

### Motivation

Joker Calculus is a strongly normalizing formal model
of higher duality between [Platonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism)
and [Seshatism](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/papers-wip2/seshatism.pdf).

In philosophy of metaphysics, Platonism
is the view that there exists such things as abstract objects.
Platonism had a profound effect on Western thought.

In the philosophy of mathematical language design,
the [core axiom of Path Semantics](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/papers-wip/path-semantics.pdf)
implies the existence of a dual version of Platonism
called "Seshatism".

With other words, to the degree one can take the view of Platonism in philosophy,
there is a corresponding but opposite position of Seshatism.
Seshatism is just as deep and complex as Platonism, because there is a precise mathematical
relation between the two ways of constructing mathematical languages.

Seshatism must not be confused with [Nominalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism),
which is important in the debate about philosophy of metaphysics.
Nominalism plays a less important role in the philosophy of mathematical language design.
You can learn more about this in the essay
[What is Wrong With Platonism?](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/papers-wip2/what-is-wrong-with-platonism.pdf).

Seshatism is currently being studied under the
[AdvancedResearch](https://advancedresearch.github.io/) organisation.

"The Joker" as a mathematical universe was inspired by the philosophy of
[Alan Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts),
who held a [lecture](https://archive.org/details/joker-alan-watts-org-official)
about the topic.

A higher duality, in the sense of the Joker Calculus, means
that languages can have different surface and depth levels.
These configurations of surface and depth levels also have their duals.

### Open vs Closed Joker Calculus

Joker Calculus comes in two variants, one called "open" and one called "closed".

- In the closed variant, the higher dualities are [involutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics))
- In the open variant, the higher dualities are [adjoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_functors)

### Example: Open vs Closed

```rust
use joker_calculus::*;

fn main() {
    let a = seshatic(platonism());
    let b = not(a.clone());
    let b_open = b.eval_open();
    let b_closed = b.eval_closed();
    assert_eq!(b_open, platonic(joker(platonism())));
    assert_eq!(b_closed, platonic(joker(platonism())));

    let a_open = not(b_open).eval_open();
    let a_closed = not(b_closed).eval_closed();
    assert_eq!(a_open, seshatic(joker(joker(platonism()))));
    assert_eq!(a_closed, seshatic(platonism()));
}
```
